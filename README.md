A Rust crate that simulates a quantum computer.

This crate simulates a quantum computer by allowing the user to build
a quantum circuit by adding columns of gates so that a quantum register 
can be constructed (see the [quick start guide](QUICK_START.md)). 
Measurements can then be performed on this circuit to return 
observables.

### Defining features

- Aimed to be accessible to beginners in Rust.
- The distinction between physical observables and non-physical
  observables are made clear; but the latter is still possible to
  retrieve.
- Prints the circuit diagram to the terminal, or saves it to a text
  file, as a UTF-8 string.
- Custom gates can be implemented easily by giving their explicit linear
  mappings on states. This allows the user to avoid representing the
  gates as matrices.
- Attempts to minimise memory consumption by not using matrices nor
  sparse matrices, and instead uses functions to represent the linear
  mapping of gates.
- Only safe Rust code is used, and the only dependency is the
  [rand](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/) crate.

### Limitations (currently)

- Inserting **multiple n-gates or with other single gates** causes an
  issue for the printer. For now, the user has to manually make sure
  that n-gates are added by themselves one column at a time. In the near
  future, this will be resolved.
- There is **no noise** consideration, or ability to introduce noise.
- There is **no ability to add classical circuits**.

### Conventions

The ordering of the states labelling the product states of the 
circuit is defined as:

``` text 
|aâŸ© â”€â”€â”€â”€ 
|bâŸ© â”€â”€â”€â”€  âŸº |a,b,c,â‹¯âŸ© â‰¡ |aâŸ©âŠ—|bâŸ©âŠ—|câŸ©âŠ—â‹¯ 
|câŸ© â”€â”€â”€â”€
 â‹®    â‹®
``` 

When defining a custom function that depends on the position of control
nodes to define gates (such as the CNot and Toffoli gates), it must be
defined so that the most far right state of the product state, is
assumed to be the gate that is "activiated". In general, it is better to
assume that the custom function doesn't define control nodes, but rather 
that it extends the dimension of its domain. 

### Documentation 

> There are plans to create a
> [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) that gives the
> background and theory behind quantr.

For the online code documentation, please refer to 
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/quantr). This can also be built and 
opened in your favourite webrowser locally by cloning the project, 
moving into the directory, and running `cargo doc --open`. 

### Other quantum computer simulators 

As of 27th July 2023, the website [Are We Quantum
Yet](https://arewequantumyet.github.io/]) lists all things quantum
computing in Rust. 

A useful and very practical simulator in learning quantum computing is
[Quirk](https://algassert.com/quirk). It's a real-time online simulator
that inerfaces via drag-and-drop gates. Note that Quirk uses the reverse
ordering of labelling their states from the quantum circuit as defined
here.
