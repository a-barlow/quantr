# Reporting

Please report any issues to GitHub which can be found at 
https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam.

# Why this GitHub repository is not moderated 

This repository mostly follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), where the moderation
and enforcement of this conduct is NOT guaranteed. 

I realise that this may be disappointing to hear as a large component of
this Conduct is the enforcement of its standards. However, this project may be
in-active for large periods of time where no moderator can take action if
needs be. So, in the interest of not creating an illusion of a safe space that is 
moderated, the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct is not being
followed.

If there are any issues that you wish to report, please use the GitHub
reporting services that can be found at
https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam.
